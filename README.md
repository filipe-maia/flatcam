FlatCAM: 2D Computer-Aided PCB Manufacturing
============================================

(c) 2014-2016 Juan Pablo Caram

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing.

To start this program you need Python installed in your computer (tested with version 3.13.4).

Before starting this program for the first time on your computer, make sure you have all the required Python dependencies by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (and, if you are on Windows, 'pip install -r requirements_windows.txt' as well).

To start this program run 'py flatcam' or 'python flatcam'.

TODO: This error happens sometimes while starting flatcam, but application doesn't seem to bug out, so this is a minor bug.

TODO: Check if reading files other than Gerber also produces a similar error that existed when opening Gerber files and that was corrected on commit 2025/06/10 10h41m GMT+1:

TODO: Related with the previous bug, file name on the UI (and probably everywhere else) is ```example.gbr', 'All Files (*)')``` instead of beeing ```example.gbr```, but application doesn't seem to bug out, so this is a minor bug.

TODO: Related with the previous bug, if file name and path is empty what happens?
