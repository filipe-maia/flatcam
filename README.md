============================================

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing.

To start this program you need Python installed in your computer (tested with version 3.13.4).

Before starting this program for the first time on your computer, make sure you have all the required Python dependencies by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

To start this program run 'py flatcam'.
