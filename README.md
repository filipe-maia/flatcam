FlatCAM: 2D Computer-Aided PCB Manufacturing
============================================

(c) 2014-2016 Juan Pablo Caram

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing.

To start this program you need Python installed in your computer (tested with version 3.13.4).

Before starting this program for the first time on your computer, make sure you have all the required Python dependencies by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (and, if you are on Windows, 'pip install -r requirements_windows.txt' as well).

To start this program run 'py flatcam' or 'python flatcam'.

If you are using Windows, you can use FlatCAM.bat.

NOTE: To use FlatCAM in an O.S. different from win64, delete the three folders of Shapely inside FlatCAM folder, then download Shapely 1.8.5 for the target O.S. and place it inside FlatCAM folder.
TODO: remove shapely 1.8.5_win64 from inside project folder and use the one installed by pip with the requirements.txt.

TODO: For example, after clicking on button to generate CNC (this is probably related with the TODO "if using shapely versions 2.x the green areas won't be drawn"):

TODO: If using shapely versions 2.x the green areas won't be drawn. This is maybe related with the TODO "for example, after clicking on button to generate CNC".

TODO: This error happens sometimes while starting FlatCAM, but application doesn't seem to bug out, so this is a minor bug.
